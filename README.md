# mulithreaded-sort-benchmarking
An exploration of multithreading and object oriented design in C++.  Provides support for benchmarking runtime performance of multithreaded algorithms utilizing various thread quantities.  Abstract classes are provided for ease of extension to additional algorithms.

An explanation of the design decisions made in the project may be found in "Project Report.pdf".  An explanation of the theory used may be found in the slides of "Course Project Presentation.pptx".
